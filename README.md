<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Freshwater is a critical resource for life, and yet it is often taken for granted. With this in mind, we set out to create a platform that would raise awareness about the importance of freshwater, and provide resources and information to help individuals and communities take action to protect and conserve this vital resource.</li>
    <li>Our webpage includes information about our organization and our mission, as well as resources for individuals and communities to get involved in freshwater conservation efforts.</li>
    <li>We have also included features such as interactive maps to help users identify freshwater resources in their area, and a forum for discussion and collaboration among individuals and organizations working towards the same goal.</li>
    <li>We believe that our webpage has the potential to make a real impact in promoting access to freshwater resources, and we are excited to share it with you today. Thank you for considering our project, and we look forward to answering any questions you may have.</li>
